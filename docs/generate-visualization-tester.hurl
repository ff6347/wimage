      "summary": "Article Summaries:Man- Biology: Men are typically XY with SRY-driven testes development and show sexual dimorphism—taller, heavier, more lean and bone mass, less fat—plus secondary traits like broader shoulders, more body hair, and deeper voices at puberty. - Reproductive system: The male reproductive system comprises testes (sperm production), epididymides, vasa deferentia and ducts, accessory glands, and external penis and scrotum, with testosterone and anti-Müllerian hormone guiding differentiation and puberty hormones initiating spermatogenesis. - Health: Men have shorter lifespans and higher mortality from war, violence, and dangerous jobs, are often underserviced by doctors, and face elevated health risks linked to economic stress and masculine norms. - Sex or gender identity: Most men are cisgender within gender-binary cultures, but some are trans men or intersex, with about 0.256% identifying as female-to-male transgender and female-assigned adolescents reporting trans identity at roughly twice the rate of male-assigned peers. - Masculinity: Masculinity is a culturally shaped set of traits and roles associated with men that varies across time and place, may have some biological influences, confers social status, and can impose stigma and pressure to protect, provide, and procreate. WindowWindows are openings in buildings or vehicles, usually glazed, that admit light and views and often open for ventilation and security. From early unglazed holes and hide or paper coverings, windows evolved through Roman glass and medieval mullions to 19th‑century plate glass and today’s clear glazing. Common types include fixed, single- and double-hung sash, horizontal sliders, casement/awning/hopper, pivot, tilt-and-turn, transom and sidelights, jalousie, clerestory/skylight/roof, bay/oriel, picture, stained glass, French, and egress designs. Modern construction uses frames of uPVC, composites, wood, or aluminum and insulated glazing (double/triple panes) with low‑e coatings and inert gas fills to improve thermal and acoustic performance and resist condensation. Solar-aware design uses orientation and shading to control heat and glare, passive-solar windows to boost comfort and efficiency, and photovoltaic glazing to generate electricity while preserving daylight and views.\nHoodieA hoodie is a hooded sweatshirt, typically with drawstrings and front pockets—a single kangaroo pocket on pullovers or two on zip-ups—worn for style and for protection from cold, wind, or rain. Hoodie—short for hooded sweatshirt, from Anglo-Saxon hōd—entered popular usage in the 1990s, can mean \"hooligan\" in UK/Irish slang, and in Canada is the dominant term with regional variants like Saskatchewan’s \"bunnyhug.\" Evolving from medieval hooded garments to 1930s Champion workwear, the hoodie was popularized in the 1970s by hip hop, high fashion, and sports, and by the 1990s carried connotations of isolation and youth subcultures. In the UK, hoodies became associated with antisocial behavior and \"chav\" culture, prompting bans like Bluewater’s 2005 code, political debate from \"Save the Hoodie\" to Cameron’s \"hug a hoodie\" remarks, and fashion controversies such as Burberry’s 2019 \"noose\" hoodie. In the U.S., hoodies moved from 1930s utilitarian roots to mainstream fashion via hip hop, later becoming charged symbols in cases like Trayvon Martin and the Black Lives Matter movement even as figures like Mark Zuckerberg normalized them in tech."
